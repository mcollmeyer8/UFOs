# UFOs
Module 11 - JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs

## Overview
For this project, we helped our friend Dana gather info about UFO Sightings that took place in 2010, and create her own informative website.
We built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, complete with filters to make the table incredibly user-friendly.
We created a customiezd website using Bootstrap, to share our table full of info with other UFO afficianados.

## Results
Our table is full of great info about UFO sightings in 2010. In case users would like to filter the data by specific info, we created filters.
Users can filter the table by date, city, state, country or shape. 
Simply plug in whichever type of data you like in its respective Filter Search box, and the info requested will be displayed.

Here is a screen shot of all of the filter options
